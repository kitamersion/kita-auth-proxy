# Requests

To test the requests, you can use [kita auth proxy](https://kita-auth-proxy.onrender.com) domain:

- Visit the docs page. This uses swagger to generate docs that contains instructions on how to make requests.
- Follow the instructions on the Swagger docs page to make your request.

Note: Recommend using this site for testing because it makes requests over HTTPS.

**OR**

You can use vscode extension REST CLIENT: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)
